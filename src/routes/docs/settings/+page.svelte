<h1>Settings file</h1>
<p class="summary">
	Your preferences live in one JSON file. Just like <a href="/docs/themes">themes</a>, it's picked
	up on the fly.
</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Linux</td><td><code>~/.config/sonora/settings.json</code></td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Flatpak</td>
			<td><code>~/.var/app/io.github.nolight132.sonora/config/sonora/settings.json</code></td>
		</tr>

<h2 id="editing">Editing by hand</h2>
<p>
	Missing keys use their defaults. Unknown keys are ignored, and they disappear the next time Sonora
	saves, because it rewrites the whole file. Here is an example of a valid settings.json:
</p>
<Code label="settings.json" lang="json" text={example} />
<p>
	Break the formatting and Sonora shows <strong>Fix line N of settings.json to save changes</strong
	>. It won't save anything until you do. It also won't overwrite the file if something else changed
	it since Sonora last read it.
</p>

<p>
	Save as UTF-8. Since v0.42.0, a UTF-8 byte order mark, which some Windows editors add, is accepted
	too.
</p>
<h2 id="not-here">What isn't in the file</h2>
<p>
	The selected provider, volume, queue resume position, window layout and other runtime state are
	saved in <code>state.sqlite</code>. Provider sign-in credentials live in separate files in the
	cache folder. Linked scrobbling accounts, including their tokens and secrets, are stored in
	<code>settings.json</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="other-files">Other files</h2>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Folder</th><th>What's in it</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Data</td>
			<td>
				<code>state.sqlite</code>, in <code>~/.local/share/sonora</code>,
				<code>~/Library/Application Support/sonora</code> or <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\sonora</code>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cache</td>
			<td>
				Sign-in credentials, the Widevine module, cached lyrics and artwork, and the local scan
				index, in
				<code>~/.cache/sonora</code>, <code>~/Library/Caches/sonora</code> or
				<code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\sonora</code>. Removing provider credential files signs you out of
				those providers.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p class="note">
	On Windows, data and cache share the same folder. Deleting the whole folder also removes
	<code>state.sqlite</code>, including local playlists and favorites.
</p>

<h2 id="home-manager">Home Manager</h2>
<p>
	The flake has a Home Manager module. Anything under <code>settings</code> gets merged into settings.json
	on every switch and every launch. Keys you don't set keep whatever you picked in the app.
</p>
<Code label="home.nix" text={homeManager} />
<p>
	Use the same preference keys as settings.json. A <code>provider</code> key does not switch services,
	because the selected provider belongs to runtime state.
</p>
