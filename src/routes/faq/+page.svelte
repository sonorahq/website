			<h2>Installing</h2>
			<div class="questions">
				<Question id="macos-damaged" question="Why does macOS say Sonora is damaged?">
					<p>
						It isn't. Sonora isn't signed with an Apple developer certificate yet, so macOS
						quarantines it. Clear the flag once after installing.
					</p>
					<Code text="xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sonora.app" />
					<p>
						Once in a while, macOS may show this dialog again even after whitelisting the app. Run
						this command again to get rid of it.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="windows-warning" question="Why does Windows warn about an unknown publisher?">
					<p>
						The Windows builds aren't code-signed yet. We've applied to the SignPath Foundation for
						that. Until it comes through, click
						<MenuPath steps={['More info', 'Run anyway']} /> the first time.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="blank-window" question="Why is the window blank, or why won't Sonora start?">
					<p>
						Sonora draws with Vulkan, and the Vulkan loader alone isn't enough. You need a driver
						for your GPU, such as <code>mesa-vulkan-drivers</code>, <code>vulkan-radeon</code>,
						<code>vulkan-intel</code> or the proprietary NVIDIA driver. Run
						<code>vulkaninfo --summary</code> to see whether one works.
					</p>
					<p>
						If Sonora starts but feels sluggish, <code>SONORA_BLUR=0</code> turns off the lyric blur,
						edge fades and visualizer.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="linux-no-sound" question="Why is there no sound on Linux?">
					<p>
						Sonora plays through ALSA. If it says <strong>no audio output device</strong>, you're
						missing the ALSA bridge to your sound server. Install <code>pipewire-alsa</code> on
						PipeWire or <code>pulseaudio-alsa</code> on PulseAudio. The AppImage doesn't bundle it either.
					</p>
				</Question>
			</div>

			<h2>Signing in</h2>
			<div class="questions">
				<Question id="spotify-sign-in" question="Why does Spotify sign-in fail?">
					<ul>
						<li>Free accounts don't get in. You need Premium.</li>
						<li>
							The sign-in window hands the session back to Sonora on <code>127.0.0.1:8989</code>.
							Close whatever else holds that port and try again.
						</li>
						<li>
							A region error means Spotify won't serve your account from where you're connecting.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</Question>

				<Question id="sign-in-window" question="Why doesn't the sign-in window open on Linux?">
					<p>
						The login windows for YouTube Music, Apple Music and Deezer need WebKitGTK, either
						<code>webkit2gtk-4.1</code> or <code>4.0</code>. Without it Sonora says
						<strong>webkit2gtk is not installed</strong> and offers cookie pasting instead. That works
						just as well.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="lastfm" question="Why won't Last.fm link?">
					<p>
						Sonora waits five minutes for Last.fm on <code>127.0.0.1:8990</code>. Make sure that
						port is free, then approve Sonora in the browser before the time runs out.
					</p>
				</Question>
			</div>

			<h2>Playback</h2>
			<div class="questions">
				<Question id="spotify-playback-keys" question="Why won't Spotify play anything?">
					<p>
						If every track fails with <strong
							>Spotify is not granting this account playback keys</strong
						>, Spotify won't work for your account in Sonora. Sonora plays Spotify through
						librespot, and
						<a href="https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/issues/1649">librespot issue 1649</a
						> tracks the problem.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="widevine" question="Why won't Apple Music play?">
					<p>
						Apple Music needs the Widevine module. When none of your browsers has a copy, Sonora
						offers to download it from Google. If you dismissed that or it never showed up, get it
						from <MenuPath steps={['Settings', 'Playback', 'Widevine module']} />.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="skipping" question="Why did playback stop after a few tracks?">
					<p>
						When several tracks in a row fail, Sonora stops instead of burning through your whole
						queue. The log has the reason.
					</p>
				</Question>
			</div>

			<h2>Settings and themes</h2>
			<div class="questions">
				<Question id="theme-grayed-out" question="Why is my custom theme grayed out?">
					<p>
						Turn off <strong>Adaptive theme</strong>. While it's on, you can only pick System, Dark
						and Light. See <a href="/docs/themes">Custom themes</a>.
					</p>
				</Question>

				<Question id="settings-not-saved" question="Why don't my settings changes stick?">
					<p>
						You probably broke the formatting of settings.json. Sonora shows
						<strong>Fix line N of settings.json to save changes</strong> and won't save anything
						until you fix it. See <a href="/docs/settings">Settings file</a>.
					</p>
				</Question>
